My Elm solutions to the [Advent of Code - 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/).

For development:

    cd ~/.../advent-of-code-2022
    elm reactor
    
Then aim your browser at http://localhost:8000, and click on a day.

Or, use Ellie:

* [Template](https://ellie-app.com/kjQDKqvCWxDa1)
* [Day 1](https://ellie-app.com/kjQH5tzKxV2a1)
* [Day 1, part 2](https://ellie-app.com/kjQLHMvynpZa1)

The Ellie links make it very easy to cheat. Listen to your conscience.
